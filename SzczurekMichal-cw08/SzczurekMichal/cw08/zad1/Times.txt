Testy wykonaem na maszynie wirtualnej mającej dostęp do 4 rdzeni procesora (rzeczywisty system ma dostęp do 8).

Podziału w 1. wariancie dokonałem stosując algorytm zachłanny przydzielający poszczególnym wątkom kolejne wartości pikseli
do przetworzenia aż liczba pikseli do przetworzenia nie przekroczy cąłkowitej liczby podzielonej przez liczbę wątków.
Sposób ten dawał dość dobre rezultaty, co mozna zobaczyć w wydruku z programu.

Dla 1. wariantu cąłkowity czas programu rośnie wraz ze wzrostem liczby wątków.
Czas wykonywania się poszczególnych wątków jest uśredniając jednakowy.
Wynika to z faktu, że najbardziej kosztownym elementem funkcji jest przejrzenie całej tablicy,
a nie zamienienie wartości poszczególnych elementów. Wraz z liczbą wątków rośnie czas potrzebny na ich obsłużenie,
jak i liczba przeglądnięć całej tablicy.

Dla 2 wariantu najkrótszy był czas wykonywanie się programu dla 2 wątków.
Poza tym całkowity czas rósł, jednak pozostawał zdecydowanie mniejszy niż ten dla 1. wariantu.
Ponadto poszczególne wątki wykonywały się coraz szybciej wraz ze wzrostem ich liczby - 
w jednym wątku trzeba było przejrzeć coraz mniejszy obszar tablicy.
Całość nie zawsze była szybsza, ponieważ część czasu była tracona na tworzenie i zakończenie wątków.
